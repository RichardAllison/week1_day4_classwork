  # 2. For a given person, return their favourite tv show
  # (e.g. for @person2, function should return the string "Baywatch")


  # 3. For a given person, check if they like a particular food
  # (e.g. function should return true for @person3 when checked for "stew", false for "spinach")


  # 4. For a given person, add a new name to their list of friends
  # (hint: Add a new string to the friends array, then test for the length of the array, not the return value of your add_friend method)


  # 5. For a given person, remove a specific name from their list of friends
  # (hint: Same as above, testing for the length of the array should be sufficient)


  # 6. Find the total of everyone's money
  # (hint: use the people array)


  # 7. For two given people, allow the first person to loan a given value of money to the other
  # (hint: you need to pass in the lender, the lendee, and the amount for this function)
  # (hint2: You should test if both the lender's and the lendee's money have changed)


  # 8. Find the set of everyone's favourite food joined together
  # (hint: concatenate the favourites/things_to_eat arrays together)


  # 9. Find people with no friends
  # (hint: return an array, there might be more people in the future with no friends!)


  # Optional, VERY TOUGH
  # 10. Find the people who have the same favourite tv show
